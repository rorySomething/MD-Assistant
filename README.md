# MD-Assistant
Python to help setup and run molecular dynamics simulations

This will likely turn into a repository of python scripts and modules
to ease the use of NAMD (www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) and
LAMMPS (lammps.sandia.gov/).

Likely things you can find elsewhere...
This is for coding practice and personal education.

Also eventually integrating MD processes easily with
SPPARKS (spparks.sandia.gov/) would probably be cool.
